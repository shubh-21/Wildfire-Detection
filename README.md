Wildfire Detection using Deep Learning
Project Description
Detect wildfires using satellite imagery with deep learning. This project aims to provide rapid and accurate wildfire detection to mitigate damage and save lives.

Algorithms Used
MobileNetV2
MobileNetV2 is chosen for its efficiency and accuracy in resource-constrained environments, making it ideal for real-time wildfire detection from satellite feeds.

Attention Mechanisms
Channel Attention: Emphasizes important feature channels.
Spatial Attention: Focuses on critical spatial regions.
Mixed Attention: Combines channel and spatial attention for comprehensive analysis.
