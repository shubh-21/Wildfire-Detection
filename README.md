# Wildfire Detection using Deep Learning
### Project Description
Detect wildfires using satellite imagery with deep learning. This project aims to provide rapid and accurate wildfire detection to mitigate damage and save lives.

### Algorithms Used
#### MobileNetV2
MobileNetV2 is chosen for its efficiency and accuracy in resource-constrained environments, making it ideal for real-time wildfire detection from satellite feeds.

#### Attention Mechanisms
**Channel Attention**: Emphasizes important feature channels.
**Spatial Attention**: Focuses on critical spatial regions.
**Mixed Attention**: Combines channel and spatial attention for comprehensive analysis.
